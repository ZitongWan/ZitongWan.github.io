Hello, my name is Zitong Wan. I am a third-year undergraduate student enrolled in the Joint Software Engineering Program between Beijing University of Technology (BJUT) and University College Dublin (UCD).

My academic focus revolves around data mining, with a specialized interest in recommender systems. Currently, I am exploring cutting-edge domains such as multimodal recommendation and group recommendation.
